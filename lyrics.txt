There's apples on the tree and berries on the ground
There's apples on the tree and berries on the ground
Partidge everywhere but I cant shoot one down.

Float tubes and PBR 

Take my cream and put it in your pail
Take my cream and put it in your pail
Dip it in the brook cool it down for sale

I know they'll be there waiting
Like the pulpwood in the bank
Finning in the current
Big brown oranage tanks
